## 🚀 How to use this Repository
1. Navigate to the numbered folder following the syllabus.
2. Follow the **theory** section in each folder.
3. Complete the **hands-on** lab exercises provided.
2. The Topic README (Example for Phase 1)
Each folder should have its own README.md. Here is a professional layout for Phase 1:

# Phase 1: Setup & Concepts

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Understand the internal architecture of Git.
* Set up a professional development environment.
* Configure global identities for version tracking.

---

## 📖 Theory: The Architecture Flow
Git works across four distinct areas. Understanding this flow is critical for mastering Git:
1. **Working Directory:** Where you modify files.
2. **Staging Area (Index):** Preparing files for a commit.
3. **Local Repo (.git):** Where snapshots are saved locally.
4. **Remote Repo (GitHub):** Where the code lives in the cloud.

## 🛠️ Installation & Config
### 1. Installation
* **Windows:** Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).
* **Mac:** `brew install git`
* **Linux:** `sudo apt install git-all`

### 2. Global Configuration
Run these commands after installation:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
📝 Practice Lab
[ ] Check git version using git --version.

[ ] Verify your config settings with git config --list.

# Phase 2: Basic Workflow (The Daily Cycle)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Connect local machines to GitHub.
* Master the `Add -> Commit -> Push` cycle.
* Understand the difference between `Pull` and `Fetch`.

---

## 📖 Essential Commands
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git clone <url>` | Copies a remote repository to your local machine. |
| `git status` | Shows which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked. |
| `git add <file>` | Moves changes from the Working Directory to the Staging Area. |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Saves the staged snapshot to the Local Repository. |
| `git push` | Uploads local commits to GitHub. |
| `git fetch` | Downloads updates from GitHub but does not merge them. |
| `git pull` | Downloads and automatically merges updates (Fetch + Merge). |

## 📁 The .gitignore File
Always create a `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive data (like `.env`) or system junk (like `node_modules`) from being uploaded.

## 📝 Practice Lab
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a file named `student.txt`.
3. Add, commit, and push it to a new branch.
4. Run `git log --oneline` to see your history.
Phase 3: 03-Branching-and-Merging/README.md

# Phase 3: Branching & Merging

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Understand non-linear development using branches.
* Learn to resolve Merge Conflicts.
* Compare Merging vs. Rebasing.

---

## 📖 Key Concepts
### 1. Merging
Combines two branches while preserving the history of how they joined.
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
2. Rebasing
"Re-writes" history by moving your feature branch to the tip of the main branch. It creates a cleaner, linear history.

3. Merge Conflicts
Occur when two people change the same line of code.

Solution: Open the file, choose the correct code, git add, and git commit.

📝 Practice Lab
Create a branch: git checkout -b feature-test.

Make a change and commit.

Switch back to main and merge the feature.

### Phase 4: `04-Advanced-Git-Tools/README.md`
```markdown
# Phase 4: Advanced Git Tools

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Use `Stash` to save work-in-progress.
* Use `Cherry-pick` to move specific commits.
* Use `Squash` to clean up messy commit histories.

---

## 📖 Advanced Commands
* **Stash:** Use `git stash` when you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit. Use `git stash pop` to bring changes back.
* **Cherry-pick:** `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` allows you to grab a single commit from another branch.
* **Tagging:** `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release version 1.0"` marks a specific point in history as important.

## 📝 Practice Lab
1. Make a change, then run `git stash`.
2. Observe that your changes "disappear."
3. Run `git stash pop` to see them return.
Phase 5: 05-Undo-and-Troubleshoot/README.md
Markdown

# Phase 5: Undo & Troubleshoot (The Panic Button)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Learn how to safely undo mistakes.
* Understand the "Dangerous" vs. "Safe" undo commands.

---

## 📖 Revert vs. Reset
| Command | Effect | Safety |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `git revert` | Creates a NEW commit that does the opposite of a previous one. | **Safe** (Best for shared code) |
| `git reset --soft` | Undoes the commit but keeps your code changes. | **Medium** |
| `git reset --hard` | Deletes the commit and all code changes. | **Dangerous** (Data loss!) |

## 🛠️ Common Errors & Solutions
* **"Updates were rejected":** You need to `git pull` before you can `git push`.
* **"Detached HEAD":** You checked out a commit instead of a branch. Run `git checkout main`.
Phase 6: 06-Org-and-RBAC/README.md
Markdown

# Phase 6: Enterprise Admin & RBAC

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Manage teams using GitHub Organizations.
* Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

---

## 📖 Enterprise Management
1. **Organizations:** Create a shared space for multiple repositories.
2. **Teams:** Group students/developers into teams (e.g., "Frontend Team").
3. **Permissions:**
   * **Read:** Can view code.
   * **Write:** Can push code.
   * **Admin:** Can delete the repo and manage settings.

## 🛡️ Branch Protection Rules
In GitHub Settings, you can prevent people from pushing directly to the `main` branch
